- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @its-mig
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in becoming a software developer. I was a waiter for my entire adult hood, and at 28, I quit my job to study code full time.
- I joined github to have access to good sources of information and to hopefully help me acheive my goal of becoming a software developer.
- ðŸŒ± i started with html/css as it was recommended by many and boy was it a good choice. Html and css has opened my eyes to how insane and beautiful coding is and has giving me a solid foundation and level of understanding to continue learning. I'm now currently learning Javascript, wish me luck!!
